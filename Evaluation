More things to consider beyond usability are. 
-	Efficacy (will the system deliver the desired effect?)
-	Performance (will it perform as required?)
-	Accessibility (will the system be truly accessible?)
-	Security (will the system be secured?)
-	Validity (will the system use and deliver valid data?)
-	Acceptance (will the target users accept the system?)
-	Workload (is the perceived workload acceptable?)
-	Maintenance (can the system remain usable into the future?)
-	Sustainability (does the system impact the environment?)
